# MQTools
A repository of useful bits of code for processing IBM MQ.

## C samples 
  1. One for putting an getting messages - with bugs to educate people on debugging MQ!
  1. One acting as a MQ server in C  

## Python code

These build on the low level MQ services provided by [pymqi](https://dsuch.github.io/pymqi/). 

A header file to process IBM MQ monitoring data is provided in tools/monitor.h 

This code is alpha level - I have tested many areas - but there are going to be areas I havent covered,
and I am still finding small problems with formatting etc.


I would welcome suggestions, comments, and reports of bugs.  Please contact me at ColinPaiceMQ@GMAIL.COM
or raise an issue on [MQTools GitHub](https://github.com/colinpaicemq/MQTools).

If you want to install it use

**pip3 -v  install   git+http://github.com/colinpaicemq/MQTools/** and it will install mqtools.
 
 to uninstall it use
 
 pip3 -v  uninstall mqtools


These tools covers

* **mqpcf** - MQ PCF Processor for creating MQ PCF requests,  and a parser to decode the
response and store it in a dict.   This builds on top of pymqi.
    * A general purpose Python program get_pcf is provided in the examples so you can get the
      messages, decode them, and print them - so you just need so write small programs to process it.

* **formatMQMD** for converting a MD from pymqi into a dict with values converted 
  to strings.

* Examples.   The following are Python examples. 
  * **get_pcf** - reads from the specified queue and outputs the data in json, so you can post process it.
       ```
      Input parameters:
      -qm queue_manager_name
       <-channel channel name>
       <-conname 'ipaddress(1414)' >
       <-userid  userid> 
       <-password <Password_value> >  if password_value not specificied then it prompts
       -queue   q_name  the name of the queue to be processed
       <-count n> the number of messages to process - useful while testing so you do not drain the queue.

       SYSTEM.* queues include:  
                    SYSTEM.ADMIN.ACCOUNTING.QUEUE, 
                    SYSTEM.ADMIN.ACTIVITY.QUEUE, 
                    SYSTEM.ADMIN.CHANNEL.EVENT, 
                    SYSTEM.ADMIN.COMMAND.EVENT, 
                    SYSTEM.ADMIN.CONFIG.EVENT, 
                    SYSTEM.ADMIN.LOGGER.EVENT, 
                    SYSTEM.ADMIN.PERFM.EVENT, 
                    SYSTEM.ADMIN.PUBSUB.EVENT, 
                    SYSTEM.ADMIN.QMGR.EVENT, 
                    SYSTEM.ADMIN.STATISTICS.QUEUE, 
                    SYSTEM.ADMIN.TRACE.ACTIVITY.QUEUE,
                    SYSTEM.ADMIN.TRACE.ROUTE.QUEUE

       Output:
       json formatted output to stdout, which can be piped to other programs such as python3 pretty_json
       ```

      
    * **pretty_json** - reads json stream and prints the data in a pretty format which is easy to use.  
         You use it as follows.
         
         _python3 get_pcf -qm ....  |python3 pretty_json_ 
  * **events** - uses mqpcf to read from the events queue and prints the data in json format.
    Copy the examples/event* to your current directory and change the queue manager information in 
    events.py 
    * **events2**  takes the output from events and procesess a summary of the change events.
      _python3 events.py |python3 events2_.   This produces summary 
      of the events such as 
      ```
       create Q_NAME DQUEUE DQUEUE
       difference Q_NAME DQUEUE DQUEUE Q_DESC  newDesc 
       difference Q_NAME DQUEUE DQUEUE MAX_Q_DEPTH 5000 10
       Delete Q_NAME DQUEUE DQUEUE
       Create Q_NAME D2 D2
       difference Q_NAME D2 D2 MAX_Q_DEPTH 5000 40
       Delete CHANNEL_NAME CH1 CH1
       ```
  * **getqueues** connects to MQ, issues a PCF command to query queues and write
    json output to print
    
    Copy the examples/getqueues*.py to your current directory and change the queue manager information in 
    getqueues.py.  Change the queue_name to your queue name prefix of interest
    
    * **getqueues2** takes the json output from getqueue and writes it to files in the queues/ directory
    in yaml format.
    Create a directory queues in your current directory
  * **diff** takes a list of *.yaml files (eg for queues) and compares the options
      so you can see what attributes are different.
      ```
      ./queues/CP0000.yml ./queues/CP0001.yml : Q_NAME CP0000 / CP0001
      ./queues/CP0000.yml ./queues/CP0001.yml : Q_DESC Main queue / 
      ./queues/CP0000.yml ./queues/CP0001.yml : MAX_Q_DEPTH 2000 / 5000
      ./queues/CP0000.yml ./queues/CP0001.yml : Q_DEPTH_HIGH_EVENT ENABLED / DISABLED
      ```
  * **standards** reads the specified *.yaml files and checks the parameters to 
      ensure they meet the specified standards.
      Copy the standards.py file from examples directory to your working directory, and change the 
      parameters to match what you want to check.
      
      The supplied example has 
      ignore = ["ALTERATION_DATE","ALTERATION_TIME","CREATION_DATE","CREATION_TIME"]

      less_than = {"CURRENT_Q_DEPTH":50,
                  }
       
      greater_than = {"MAX_MSG_LENGTH":4194304,
                      "MAX_Q_DEPTH":9999,
                     } 
      
      not_equal = {"INHIBIT_PUT":"PUT_ALLOWED",
                  "INHIBIT_GET":"GET_ALLOWED",
                  "SHAREABILITY":"SHAREABLE",
                 }
      
      You could create a yaml file with the parameters in it, and then use that.
      ```
      queues/CP00000.yml MAX_MSG_LENGTH 4000 Field in error.  It should be greater than 4194304
      queues/CP00000.yml MAX_Q_DEPTH 5000 Field in error.  It should be greater than 9999
      ```

  * **appltag**. This summarises the output of the dis qstatus(queue*) type(handle) and 
     give a count of unique queue,  userid, applytag.


# MQ PCF processor

This code builds on pymqi  allows you to process a message in PCF format. 

## Processing MQ PCF data into a dict

You use pymqi to get data from an MQ Queue, then mqpcf can parse this data to create a 
dict with the data from
the different structures, and with internal numbers converted to strings 
where applicable.

The output would be

### Header

```
  {'Type': 'COMMAND', 
    'StrucLength': 36, 
    'Version': 1, 
    'Command':'INQUIRE_CHLAUTH_RECS', 
    'MsgSeqNumber': 1, 
    'Control': 'LAST', 
    'CompCode': 0, 
    'Reason': 0,
    'ParameterCount': 1, 
   'sReason': 'NONE'
  }
```
Where the mqpcf code has change the returned the command value of 204 to MQCMD_INQUIRE_CHLAUTH_RECS and 
returned  "INQUIRE_CHLAUTH_RECS"
 
### Data

```
  {'CHANNEL_NAME': 'SYSTEM.ADMIN.SVRCONN',
   'CHLAUTH_TYPE': 'ADDRESSMAP',
   'CHLAUTH_DESC': 'Default rule to allow MQ Explorer access',
   'CUSTOM': '', 
   'CONNECTION_NAME': '*',
   'USER_SOURCE': 'CHANNEL',
   'CHECK_CLIENT_BINDING': 'AS_Q_MGR',
   'ALTERATION_DATE': '2018-08-16',
   'ALTERATION_TIME': '13.32.16'
  }
```
Where the mqpcf code has changed the values returned in the message to "ADDRESSMAP" etc.

This can process messages on from queues such as 
SYSTEM.ADMIN.*.QUEUE and SYSTEM.ADMIN.*.EVENT.  See the code in the examples directory,
these produces json output which you can then pipe into other supplied samples
to do useful things with it.  See above



## Issuing PCF commands
You can create a PCF message and then use pymqi to put it to the 
SYSTEM.ADMIN.COMMAND.QUEUE for example

```
  from mqtools import mqpcfset as mqpcfset
  pcfset = mqpcfset.mqpcfset()
  message=pcfset.create_request(  "INQUIRE_CHLAUTH_RECS" 
                          ,{"CHANNEL_NAME":"*"}                 
                        )
```
or
```
  from mqtools import mqpcfset as mqpcfset
  pcfset = mqpcfset.mqpcfset()
  message=pcfset.create_request("INQUIRE_Q_STATUS"
                         ,{"Q_NAME":"AMQ*"}
                         ,{"CURRENT_Q_DEPTH":("EQ",0)}
                        )
```

You specify strings instead of the cryptic constants 

## appltag 

Use this python script to process the output from runmqsc DIS QSTATUS(queue) 
to summarise the userids and appltags using the queue.

For example on Linux  

echo "dis QSTATUS(CP000\*) type(handle) all" |runmqsc QMA |python appltag.py  

produces
```
    *(',q=CP0000,user=colinpaice,appltag=fromQMAJMS', 43)*  
    *(',q=CP0000,user=colinpaice,appltag=oemput', 1)*  
    *(',q=CP0002,user=colinpaice,appltag=COLINMDBCF', 36)*  
    *(',q=CP0002,user=colinpaice,appltag=oemput', 1)*  
```

echo "dis conn(\*) all  "|runmqsc QMA |python appltag.py   

produces  
```
    *(',user=colinpaice,appltag=COLINMDBCF', 98)*  
    *...*  
    *(',user=colinpaice,appltag=fromQMAJMS', 52)*  
    *(',user=colinpaice,appltag=runmqchi', 1)*  
    *(',user=colinpaice,appltag=runmqsc', 1)*  
```

The code for processid id (pid) has been commented out, as with 
clients this is just an MQ
program. This is not very useful
